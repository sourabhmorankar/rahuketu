## COMPLETED COMPONENTS STATUS

### Working Components
1. **BentoGrid** - Basic pan/zoom functionality with Svelte 5 runes
2. **InnerCard** - Card system with size variants and selection
3. **BioCard** - Professional bio display with Rahul's information
4. **ActionIcons** - Navigation icons with state management
5. **MiniMap** - Grid overview with click navigation
6. **Grid State Management** - Svelte 5 runes with reactive position/zoom
